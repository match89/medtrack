# Angular 20 Workshop

## Introduction

In this workshop, we will build a simple yet fully functional Angular 20 application in the medical domain. The goal is to learn modern Angular concepts and master the basics of sustainable SPA development.

### Application

**Name:** MedTrack

**Problem:** Doctors and patients need a simple overview of the medications a patient is taking, their dosages, and prescriptions.

**Solution:** We will create a web application where users can:

* view patients,
* see patient details and their medications,
* add, edit, and delete medications.
